title1: About Me
---
I am based in Honolulu, HI but I'm open to relocating anywhere or even  working in a remote environment! I have developed interests in functional programming (specifically Haskell), blockchain, and fintech due to my background in the financial industry (undergraduate education and early career experience).  
<br />
So far, my experience with programming has led me to favor backend development. Although that does not mean that I don't appreciate good design, I just enjoy the process of writing backend code and appreciating the hard work of frontend developers!  
<br />
I'm always trying to improve myself whether that be in the professional world or everyday life.
